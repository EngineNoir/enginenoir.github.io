            <h2>What is HTML</h2>
            <p>
                HTML, or HyperText Markup Language is a type of script that
                can be used to create the layout and contents of a website.<br><br>
                
                It consists of <em>tags</em> and <em>elements</em>. A tag 
                indicates the styling or function of something, while an element
                is a named component of the HTML file, like a section.<br><br>

                For example: to make text <strong>bold</strong> it needs to be placed
                inside the "&lt;strong&gt;" tag. Whenever tags are opened, they need to
                be closed too, with a "&lt;/strong&gt;" tag, for example.<br><br>

                Additional options can be placed inside the tags, for example:<br><br>

                <img src="../../images/html.png"><br><br>

                This page has very simple and readable HTML, and a hidden flag!<br><br>

                You can inspect it via the <em>Web Developer Tools</em>, which you
                can select from your browser's application menu.
                
                Usually it's located at:<br><br>
                application menu -> tools -> web developer tools<br><br>
                but it can also generally be accessed by pressing F12!<br><br>

                From here you can select the <em>Inspector</em> tool to view HTML.<br><br>

                <img src="../../images/inspector.png"><br><br>

                Alternatively you can write "view-source:" in front of the URL.<br><br>
